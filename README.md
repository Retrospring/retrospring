![Retrospring](https://github.com/Retrospring/retrospring/workflows/Retrospring/badge.svg)

This is the source code that powers Retrospring. This is a detached fork of
[nilsding/justask](https://github.com/nilsding/justask), where we continue
development.

Retrospring shut down on June 12, 2016, but it's somehow still alive.  You're
welcome.
