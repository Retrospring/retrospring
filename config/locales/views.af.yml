            You can create lists and add users to them using the <i class="fa fa-fw fa-list"></i>
            icon in the navigation on user profiles that are not yours.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once you have done that, the lists will be shown here.
            When you select a list you'll get a timeline view of all users within that list.
